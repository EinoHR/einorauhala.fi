{{<monospace>}}
like every hallway, the “infinite-hallway” ends too.<br>
it might feel infinite, after every day there’s another<br> 
changes are so slow<br>
sometimes it might already feel like it ends<br>
but the real end comes, at the end<br>
{{</monospace>}}

made this in like two days again   
not having time to overdo/overthink makes me release more   
being more experimental also helps   

the idea was shifting a piano down -18 hertz so that everything sounds kinda out of tune   
the scale is d minor but i occasionally go out of scale for effect   
this is what came out
