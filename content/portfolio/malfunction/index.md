Submission for the Save media art event.

“Malfunction is an audiovisual artwork with an electric soundscape and a scifi-inspired video. In it you get to experience a small slice of a science fiction world, where regardless of new technology errors are not avoided.”

Soundscape made completely using Ableton Live [1] during january 2021 and the video using Blender [2], Davinci Resolve [3] and Krita [4] during april 2021.
