Lyrics by GPT-2 from talktotransformer.com, in the form the AI made them:<br>
<br>
The souls rise<br>
And the stars<br>
The merchants ‘merchants<br>
Belong to the gapers<br>
And are sold<br>
To other gulls and merchants<br>
To buy with the money<br>
<br>
The souls rise<br>
Like snowflakes, from the grave<br>
Into the earthly world,<br>
And our souls, true and true<br>
And true, may find their proper home.”<br>
<br>
The souls rise from their graves,<br>
they walk about, again and again.<br>
