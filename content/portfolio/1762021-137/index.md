Made the 17th of June 2021 in 1 hour and 37 minutes. I know, creative.

For the second song I got inspiration for the name from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FomO90HsmWw) cover by Glink which is a part of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_-fcFivTS8) amazing video essay by him, the sample I used sounded similar to the flute part.

_Q: Why the fuck am I usign the Papyrus font in the album art._
_A: It is actually a modified version of Papyrus that is even more noisy (just scribbled liquify on it)._
